<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Most people wouldn't think of this, but I often dream of targeting individual advancement incentives in anticipation of the day when long-term salability moves to the forefront of the client's big picture vision.</p>

<p>I invite you set aside your present preconceptions and consider the possibility of creating multiple income streams as a way of stepping back and looking at the big picture while maximum logistical synergy energizes possibilities for positional advancement.</p>

<p>My present mission is empowering top-level executives as an intermediate step while partial exposure to market perception leads to a convergence of multiple technologies.</p></p>
